Files in the zipped folder contain the probability of each pixel to be assigned to one of the three classes (clomun1 is LD, column 2 is ID, column 3 is HD):
1) prob_pt1.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=1) (i.e. 3 is the last number).
2) prob_pt2.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=2) (i.e. 7 is the last number).
3) prob_pt3.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=3) (i.e. 11 is the last number).
4) prob_pt1.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=4) (i.e. 15 is the last number).

Files are named "sigma_mix_table". Output files names contain numbers which refer to the level of smoothing of I, G, E1 and E2. For I number is always 0 (level of smoothing = 1), for G is always 13 (level of smoothing = 4). For E1 and E2 there are all different combinations E1 (2,6,10,14 resp. sig=1,2,3,4) and E2 (3,7,11,15 resp. sig=1,2,3,4). Prefix "inf" and "sup" refer to lower and upper surfaces, respectively.
