Subfolders contain data used for the segmentation of the density maps and the decay analysis.
The numbering of the surface followed in the paper is different than the folders numbering, description below:
1) s1s2 contains data relative to surface 1 and 5 (s1 and s5 in the paper).
2) s3s4 contains data relative to surface 2 and 6 (s2 and s6 in the paper).
3) s5s6 contains data relative to surface 3 and 7 (s3 and s7 in the paper).
4) s7s8 contains data relative to surface 4 and 8 (s4 and s8 in the paper).
5) s9s10 contains data relative to surface 9 and 13 (s9 and s13 in the paper).
6) s11s12 contains data relative to surface 10 and 14 (s10 and s14 in the paper).
