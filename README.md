# opt_seg

Subfolders relative to the investigated surfaces (i.e. s1s5, s2s6 etc.) contain data used for the segmentation of the density maps and the decay analysis.
The numbering of the surface follows the one in the paper (Table 2 and Table 3).
Subfolder "scripts_segmentation" contains the python scripts to perfoem the segmentations, scipts should be run from inside the "0_100ns" subfolder which it is nested in each of the surface subfolders (i.e. s1s5, s2s6 etc.).
