The "all_decays_e1s4_e2s4.zip" folder contains all the decays (including the iterations for the reclassifed HDs) for E1(sig=4)-E2(sigma=4) over the 225 windows of 400ps of lenght for the BD --> pore, BD --> HD and HD --> BD transitions:

1) For the BD --> pore transitions files are named "*net_to_lay*.csv"
2) For the BD --> HD transitions files are named "*net_to_hig*.csv"
3) For the HD --> BD transitions files are named "*high_to_net*.csv"
4) Files named "*parameters*.csv" contain the fitted parameters for single and exponential fitting
5) "inf_" and "sup_" prefix correspond to lower and upper surfcaes.
