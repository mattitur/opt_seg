1) "inf_csv_no_rt_trc_highs_split_sum_0.13.14.15.csv" and "sup_csv_no_rt_trc_highs_split_sum_0.13.14.15.csv" contain the times spent in each HD regions by CO2 molecules for the lower and upper surfaces in segmenations with highest level of smoothing for E1(sig=4,14) and E2(sig=4,15).
2) the script "sum_highs_all_e1e2.py" computes the total time spent by CO2 in each region.
3) the script "label_hd_all_tot_time_all_e1e2.py" recomputes the domains to be consider for the residence time analysis when part of the HD are reclassified as BD.
4) the script "hist_2s_ads_winds.py" tracks CO2 molecules over windows of 400 frames and stores the pixels coordinates (i.e., x and y) which are used for the residence time analysis.
