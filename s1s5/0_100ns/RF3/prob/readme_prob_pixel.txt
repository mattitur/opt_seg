Files in the zipped folder contain the probability of each pixel to be assigned to one of the three classes (clomun1 is LD, column 2 is ID, column 3 is HD):
1) prob_pt1.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=1) (i.e. 3 is the last number).
2) prob_pt2.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=2) (i.e. 7 is the last number).
3) prob_pt3.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=3) (i.e. 11 is the last number).
4) prob_pt1.zip contains combinations with E2(sig=4) (i.e. 15 is the last number).
